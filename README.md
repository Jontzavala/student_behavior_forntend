# Student Behavior App

Student Behavior App is a application that allows teachers to add their courses and students and be able to filter through the courses.

In the future model I want to be able to add a behaviors feature that when you click on a students name or perhaps a behavior button that will allow the teacher to insert that students behavior habbits and also if they are present or not. The teacher will be able to filter by day to look at past behaviors and attendence.

## Prerequisites

To get started make sure you have the following things:

* You have the lastest version of javascript installed.
* You have a Mac/Windows/Linux machine.

## Installing Student Behavior App

To install Student Behavior App follow these steps:

Clone this repo as an SSH copy the link

Go to your terminal get into where you would like to store this repo in your terminal run the command ```git clone <link>```

Then cd into that repo ```cd student_behavior_frontend```

Then run ```code .```

That should open up vscode then you'll want to run ```open index.html``

That will open up the front end but we still have to get the backend up and running here is the link to that:
https://github.com/Jontzavala/student_behavior_backend
## Using Student Behavior App

First you have to make sure the backend is running before you can do anything.

After you make sure the server is running on the backend you'll be able to create a student as well as a course at once. You'll assign the student a course and a seat number.
They'll populate into the home page then you'll be able to click on a course and see which student are in that course.
